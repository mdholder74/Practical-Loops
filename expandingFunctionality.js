// Part 2: Expanding Functionality
/*Instructions
Declare a variable that stores the number of columns in each row of data within the CSV.
Instead of hard-coding four columns per row, expand your code to accept any number of columns. 
This should be calculated dynamically based on the first row of data.
Store your results in a two-dimensional array.
Each row should be its own array, with individual entries for each column.
Each row should be stored in a parent array, with the heading row located at index 0.
Cache this two-dimensional array in a variable for later use.*/

// This is a STRING of CSV tabular data. Each line is separated by a newline character (\n) while each cell is separated by a comma.
// The first line is the header row, while the next lines are the data rows.
